# pirate_chatbot_v2
Ahoy, matey! This Pirate Chatbot uses the Google Gemini API for salty, contextual conversations. It features a "Raw Data" tab for debugging. Use your own or an internal API key. Note: chat history isn't saved, and the bot's language can be impolite. It's built for educational purposes with mostly free API usage.
